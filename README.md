# Real-Time Flight Tracker Dashboard
## Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline that processes live aircraft positioning data from the OpenSky Network API. The system ingests real-time flight data, processes and enriches it with additional metrics, stores it in a PostgreSQL database, and visualizes insights through an interactive Tableau Public dashboard.
